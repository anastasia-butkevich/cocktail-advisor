# Cocktail Advisor Chat - Anastasia Butkevych

Firstly, I had to understand fully the task and technologies I will use. I'll start with developing the most simple version of the app and then, if I have time, will add more complicated functionality.
Main tasks for MVP:
- FastAPI endpoint: /chat (only one so far)
- FAISS vector store + Sentence Transformers
- Detect user preferences
- Similarity search, docs retrival

Because I'm short on time I will use similar stack of technologies as I did in Concert ChatApp project, because this task is pretty similar to that one. For LLM API I will use OpenRouter. The model I chose - "gpt-4o-mini".
